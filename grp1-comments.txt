Very awesome overall, not much to complain about.

1. Your logic to handle the balance check is currently in the
client:

=========================
if (transferService.getBalance().getBalance() >= amount) {
	Transfer transfer = new Transfer();
	transfer.setAccountFrom(currentUser.getUser().getId());
	transfer.setAccountTo(receiverID);
	transfer.setAmount(amount);
	transfer.setTransferStatusID(2);
	transfer.setTransferTypeID(2);
	transferService.addTransfer(transfer);
} else {
	System.out.println("You don't have enough money to send this amount");
}
=========================

Ideally we should do this on the server. If the server determines that
there is insufficient balance, then it should throw an exception, that
the client can catch and then display the message. 

Doing it this way also prevents you from having to do 2 API calls to the 
server.
